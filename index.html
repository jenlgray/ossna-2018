                        Fil: Adobe and Open Source don't traditionally go hand in hand,
                        but Adobe has been involved in OS, like open sourcing
                        Flex and contributing to many Apache projects. 
                        You still wouldn't think of Adobe as an open source company.
                        Is this a perception problem or something else?

                    - With no commitment to continue to support, many of those

                        - It was a grass roots 
                        type effort, with us only working on it part time. <br/>
                        - The original members were essentially volunteers as they
                        had other responsibilities as part of their day jobs.<br/>
                        - The thing 
                        that brought them together was a shared love of open 
                        source and their desire to have Adobe give back to 
                        the community.

                        - a readme file describing the basics<br/>

                        the submission process! So we started to gather
                        all of the requirements from all of the various teams
                        involved in the OS process. We took those requirements
                        and created a checklist for teams to follow.</aside>

                    <img src="images/os-submission-checklist.png" style="margin-top: 0; width:51%" />
                    <aside class="notes">
                            Steve: <br/>
                            - To manage the process, we created a git repo on our 
                        internal github. We put the checklist of all 
                        of the requirements into a issue_template.<br/>
                        - Every
                        submitter was required to create an issue in our repo 
                        and start filling out the checklist in the issue 
                        template.<br/>
                        - One big benefit of this new process meant
                        that it was open and transparent. Anyone could view
                        previous submissions and see how they went. We wanted
                        to remove the mystery behind the approvals. <br/>
                        - Over time 
                        and many discussions with various stakeholders, the list
                        grew to 53 items. The process was still daunting and 
                        a little confusing.<br/>
                        - Our plan was for the checklist to
                        be a first pass. It was quick to get up and it allowed
                        us to build relationships with the stakeholders. It gave
                        us at the open source office time to learn the nuances
                        of contributing to and open sourcing code.<br/>
                        - So earlier 
                        this year, from our learnings, we launched the new open
                        source submission form. (Hand it off to Fil to talk about that)

                            Fil: The new submission form is radically simpler.<br/>
                            - We 
                        decided to remove the ambiguous questions for more
                        simple and direct ones - easier to understand for 
                        developers (i.e. not written by lawyers).<br/>
                        - We created categorizes of 
                        open source projects that the open source office would
                        be able to approve without going through all of the 
                        stakeholders.<br/>
                        - It bolted on top of the existing process - Users
                        logged in with their enterprise Git account, and issues
                        were submitted to the existing issue tracker. No
                        surprises for anynone already involved, just a nice UI
                        on top of existing process.<br/>

                        much better.

                        - This means if one employee received approval for
                        contributing to a project, all other Adobe employees
                        could do so as well without needing to fill out forms or

                        - We integratated these

                        the new form. We also still need to add analytics to
                        the instant whitelist approvals. So we imagine our

                        a cross organizational team like us in the company.
                        We sit under the developer relations org. Would be more 
                        ideal if we sat under the CEOs office.

                        Our role is more about bringing people together. We see
                        ourselves as more of a central team to all of Adobe.

                            - every month we pound the github REST API and keep

                        - there are many flaws of this approach: we only count
                        commits as contributions (whereas we want to count
                        comments, PRs, reviews, etc.). the company-to-user
                        associations are rough at best. but that's ok.
